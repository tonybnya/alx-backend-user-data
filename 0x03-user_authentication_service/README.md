# 0x03-user_authentication_service



In the industry, we should **not** implement our own authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for us (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-User](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/9nVfotMI_1zpEzihMzBeTA "Flask-User")). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.
